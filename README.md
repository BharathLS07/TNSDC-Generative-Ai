# traffic-prediction

PROBLEM	STATEMENT

Predicting traffic is a crucial aspect of urban planning and transportation management. With the rise of smart cities and the increasing complexity of urban environments, accurate traffic prediction has become more important than ever. By analyzing historical traffic data, such as traffic flow, speed, and congestion patterns, along with real-time data from sensors and cameras, we can develop predictive models to forecast future traffic conditions. These models can help city planners optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve overall transportation efficiency. Additionally, by integrating with smart transportation systems, such as intelligent traffic lights and dynamic routing algorithms, these predictions can be used to actively manage and mitigate traffic issues in real time, creating more sustainable and livable cities for the future.




PROJECT	OVERVIEW


The project aims to develop a sophisticated traffic prediction system to enhance urban transportation management. Leveraging historical traffic data and real-time sensor information, the system will employ machine learning and data analytics techniques to forecast future traffic conditions accurately. By analyzing patterns and trends in traffic flow, congestion, and other relevant factors, the system will generate predictions that can assist city planners and transportation authorities in optimizing traffic flow and reducing congestion. Additionally, the system will be designed to integrate with existing smart transportation infrastructure, enabling real-time monitoring and management of traffic issues. Ultimately, the goal of the project is to contribute to the development of smarter, more efficient, and sustainable urban transportation systems.
