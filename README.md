#PROBLEM	STATEMENT

Predicting traffic is a crucial aspect of urban planning and transportation management. With the rise of smart cities and the increasing complexity of urban environments, accurate traffic prediction has become more important than ever. By analyzing historical traffic data, such as traffic flow, speed, and congestion patterns, along with real-time data from sensors and cameras, we can develop predictive models to forecast future traffic conditions. These models can help city planners optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve overall transportation efficiency. Additionally, by integrating with smart transportation systems, such as intelligent traffic lights and dynamic routing algorithms, these predictions can be used to actively manage and mitigate traffic issues in real time, creating more sustainable and livable cities for the future.
